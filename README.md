## **Assumptions and Future Improvements**

* **Assumptions:** It was assumed that any authenticated user can see a list of all other users in the system to facilitate the "Add Member" feature. For enhanced security, this could be restricted to only Admins.
* **Improvements:**
    * Implement the optional reporting dashboard with project progress metrics.
    * Add a comprehensive suite of backend unit tests.
    * Integrate the bonus AI-powered user story generator.
